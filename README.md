# firebridge

An experimental wrapper around Discord's API for user accounts.

## Usage
I'll update this at some point in the future. Coming from nyxx, it's a very different experience.
For my own use case, models are not actually tied to managers, so it is not possible to use the
partials pattern.

## Credits 

- Thanks to the [nyxx-discord](github.com/nyxx-discord/nyxx) projects, from which this is forked. It's a very good API wrapper for the Discord bot API, that I was able to make heavy modifications for my use case.
